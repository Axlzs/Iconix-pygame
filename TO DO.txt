[-]known resolution bug - sometimes the game does not want to exit fullscreen mode, the config file needs to be changed at that point


[-]Loading screen???!!! - preload game assets and some enemies
[-]optimise arrows
[-]reuse enemy objects
[+]collision detection



----optimization notes----

optimise the stupid arrows - not as big performace hit
reuse already created objects


preload enemies
preload arrows
 - rotate function is expensive 
 
i have to find an efficient way to make enemies not collide with each other
