[-]known resolution bug - sometimes the game does not want to exit fullscreen mode, the config file needs to be changed at that point


[-]Loading screen???!!! - preload game assets and some enemies
[-]optimise arrows
[-]reuse enemy objects
[-]find better sprites and make them bigger(will partly resolve optimization problem)





----optimization notes----

optimise the stupid arrows - not as big performace hit
reuse already created objects


preload enemies
preload arrows
 - rotate function is expensive
