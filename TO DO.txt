[-]known resolution bug - sometimes the game does not want to exit fullscreen mode, the config file needs to be changed at that point


[-]optimise arrows
[-]find better sprites and make them bigger(will partly resolve optimization problem)

[+] optimised enemies:
      enemies are preloaded
      enemies are respawned when killed so no new enemies have to be created
      new enemies spawn during upgrade screen
      player damage cooldown is now dependent on the type of enemy attacking
      added explanations in enemy class making the code more understandable 

[+] player:
      damage cooldown determined by enemies, diminishing the huge player immunity window
      attack with mouse click now 


----optimization notes----

optimise the stupid arrows - not as big performace hit

preload arrows
 - rotate function is expensive
